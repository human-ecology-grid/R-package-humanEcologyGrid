Description: Human Ecology Grid is a comprehensive multi-domain spatial database for environmental and
  socioeconomic research. It integrates data from multiple sources on a multi-resolution equal-area geodesic grid,
  providing easy-to-use aggregations. The data domains span climate, human footprint, terrain and landcover, linguistic
  territories, economic output, nighttime lights, ethnic groups power relations, and more. Panel data is provided annually
  for years 1981-2023 (where available), with an additional most recent data snapshot. The full descriptions of
  data sources and aggregations are available. Please always cite the original data when using the aggregations in your work.
